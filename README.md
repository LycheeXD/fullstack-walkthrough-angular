# Step 1

We begin by creating a helper folder to separate out details and logic from our controller file. This will help make it easier to diagnose problems and to make our files look cleaner.

We then create a helper file with a function that uses a promisified version of request to make a call to the chuck norris joke api we are using.

As we have no front end code right now, the routes can be tested using postman.
